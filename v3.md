v3 Notes
========
Note: this is just a scratch document to keep track of changes in this branch.

Tainted Uranium is the sandbox / playground branch for the upcoming 3.x version of Yasumi.

Goals:
- Resolve business issues with holidays being a working day or non-working day.
- Introducing tags (user defined) for holidays to allow for custom filtering. Getting rid of the hard coded classification
- Have each provider (i.e. country) use its own directory.
- Each holiday should be its own class. 
- Use PHPSpec for business domain related tests (in conjunction with PHPUnit)
- Overhaul of the codebase (cleanup/refactor/...)


Removed PHP7.2 support

Classnames should not have superfluous prefixes or suffixes such as 'Interface', 'Trait', 'Abstract', 'Exception' etc.
